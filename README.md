# Data Structures

## Overview

Data structures are fundamental components in computer science that enable efficient organization, management, and retrieval of data. In Python, a variety of built-in and custom data structures are available to address different computational needs. These structures, including arrays (lists), linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables (dictionaries), and trees, each offer unique advantages for various types of operations. For instance, lists provide flexible and dynamic array-like behavior, while dictionaries offer fast key-value pair storage and retrieval. Trees are essential for representing hierarchical and networked data. Understanding these data structures and their trade-offs is crucial for optimizing algorithms and solving complex problems effectively. This repository provides Python implementations and examples of these data structures, serving as a practical resource for both learning and application in software development.
